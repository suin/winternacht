## Philosophy

| Principle | |
|---|---|
| **Fragility** | Delicate enough to vanish. It doesn't assert — it simply exists. |
| **Kindness** | Every touchpoint welcomes gently. |
| **Intention** | No decoration without reason. |
| **Consistency** | Blog, slides, social, business card — the same quiet air. |

## What's Inside

Winternacht provides a unified palette of 10 chromatic scales (Accent, Sage, Sand, Clay, Lavender, Slate, Mint, Rose, Copper, Neutral), a typography system built on [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) and [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/), design tokens for spacing, radii, motion, and shadows, plus component patterns for buttons, tags, cards, code blocks, and more — all designed to carry the same quiet air from blog to business card.

See [`design-system.md`](design-system.md) for the full specification.
